Hello, I am Damie (Dah-mie) Pak. I am a general all-purpose quantitative/theoretical ecologist with an interest in insect pests and infectious disease. I received my doctorate at The Pennsylvania State University with Dr. Ottar Bjornstad. I then did a short six-month postdoc with Dr. Kat Shea before moving to Cornell to work with Dr. Megan Greischar. I am now a postdoctoral fellow at the University of South Carolina with Tad Dallas.

My main tools of the trade involve using mathematical models and data analysis! With each project, I try to learn a new analytical tool (wavelet analysis, phylogenetic regression, network analysis, etc.) to add to my toolbox. My main passion is insects because my first love was identifying parasitoid wasps. My doctoral work focused on agricultural pests. However, I also have a keen interest in disease ecology. I believe the most interesting questions in ecology lie at the intersection of theory and application. Check out the research tab to see more of my work!
