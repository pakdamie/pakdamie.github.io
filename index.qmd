Hello, I am Damie (Dah-mie) Pak. I am a quantitative/theoretical ecologist with a special interest in population dynamicsâ€”both pest and infectious disease. **I consider myself a generalist, interested in applying ecology theory and applying it to diverse systems.** I believe the most interesting questions in ecology lie at the intersection of theory and application. My main tools are mathematical models and data analysis; with each project, I strive to learn a new analytical tool (wavelet analysis, phylogenetic regression, network analysis, etc.) Check out the research tab to see more of my work!

I received my doctorate from The Pennsylvania State University, where I worked with Dr. Ottar Bjornstad to investigate **how climate drives phenology of insect pests**. As a postdoc, I became interested in infectious diseases. After graduating, I worked with Dr. Kat Shea to **model vaccine prioritization under uncertainty**. I then moved to Cornell to collaborate with Dr. Megan Greischar on **within-host modeling of malaria**. Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of South Carolina, working with Dr. Tad Dallas on various disease-related projects. Check out the research tab to see more of my work!
