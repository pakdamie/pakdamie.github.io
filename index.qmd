Hello, I am Damie (Dah-mie) Pak! I'm a data enthusiast who likes working in R (and Python) on some interesting (and weird) questions!

The past decade I was a quantitative/theoretical ecologist with a special interest in population dynamicsâ€”both pest and infectious disease. I received my doctorate from The Pennsylvania State University and spent some time as a postdoctoral scholar (working on COVID vaccinations, malaria, and Chagas disease). I'm transitioning out of academia and into a new future!
