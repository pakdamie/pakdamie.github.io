I saw the Lotka-Volterra competition model in my Introduction to Ecology class. Didn't think about it that much, and now it emerges as part of my vector control project. I wanted to brush-up my foundations, and why not make some figures!\n\n## The Lotka-Volterra Competition model\n\nThe Lotka-Volterra (LV) competition model is the seminal work that describes the dynamics of competing species. For non-ecologists, let me tell you that this is a key equation. Assume that we have two species: $N_1$ and $N_2$, let us assume they have the same growth rate: The equations are:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dN_1}{dt} = rN_1(1- (c_{11} N_1 + c_{21}N_2))\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{dN_2}{dt} = rN_2(1- (c_{22} N_2 + c_{12}N_1)).\n$$\n\nHere, the $c$ is the competition coefficient that describes how much members of it's own species ($c_{11} and c_{22}$) regulate its growth rate as well as that of the other species: $c_{12}$ and $c_{21}$). You can read the last two terms as: the competitive effect of species 1 on species 2 and vice-versa. You have have seen different formulations, especially with an explicit carrying capacity ($K$)[$rN_1(1-\\frac{(N_1 - c_{21}N_2)}{K}))$]{.aside} but I just absorbed it in the competition coefficients.\n\nSo remember:\n\n1.  $c_11$ is the competition between species 1\n2.  $c_22$ is the competition between species 2\n1.  $c_12$ is the competition of species 1 on species 2\n2.  $c_21$ is the competition  of species 2 on species 1\n\nWhy don't we make a simulation function for it:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nLV_func <- function(c_df, timestep){\n  \n  ###Competition coefficient\n  c_11 <- c_df[\"c_11\"] \n  c_12 <- c_df[\"c_12\"] \n  c_22 <- c_df[\"c_22\"] \n  c_21 <- c_df[\"c_21\"] \n\n  r = 0.01\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nSo instead of just telling you all the cool things - let's walk through it.\n\n## The math grind of finding the equilibrium:\n\nRemember to find the equilbirum, we want to set both $\\frac{dN_1}{dt}$ and $\\frac{dN_2}{dt}$ to 0. The first equilibrium is when $N_1$ is 0 and when $N_2$ is 0. Not surprising, if you have nothing present, than nothing can happen. \n\nWe can also set $N_1$ to 0 which then gives $N_2^* = \\frac{r}{c_{22}}$ and when we set $N_2$ to 0, this gives us $N_1^2 = \\frac{r}{c_{11}}$. This means that in the absence of the other competitor, these species will reach their equilibrium that is dependent on the birth rate divided by the competition coefficient.\n\nThe last condition is then the coexistence \n\n$$\nN_1^* = \\frac{c_{22} - c_{21}}{c_{22} c_{11} - c_{12}c_{21}}\n$$\nand\n$$\nN_2^* = \\frac{c_{11} - c_{12}}{c_{22} c_{11} - c_{12}c_{21}}\n$$\n\nIf you want the full derivation, unfold this section:\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n\n:::\n\n## Checking the stability\n\nSo, how should we find the stability? We create a Jacobian matrix and then calculate it at these equilibirum point\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nr - 2rc_{11} N_1 - rc_{12}N_2 & -rc_{12}N_1\\\\\n-rc_{21}N_2 & r - 2rc_{22} N_2 - rc_{21}N_1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n$$\n\n### 1. When $N_1$ = 0 and $N_2$ = 0 \n\nSubstituting it in, this is the characteristic equations\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nr - \\lambda  & 0\\\\\n0 & r - \\lambda\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n$$\n\nTherefore, $r = \\lambda$, because it's positive and real: it's unstable. So when you perturb a system at this equilibrium point, say goodbye to it, it's going to leave!\n\n### 2. When $N_1 = 0$, and $N_2^* = \\frac{r}{c_{22}}$\nI'm not gonna write this all out here, but the $\\lambda$ is negative and therefore, the equilibirum is stable.\n\n\n### 3. When $N_2 = 0$, and $N_1^* = \\frac{r}{c_{11}}$\nLikewise: I'm not gonna write this all out here, but the $\\lambda$ is negative and therefore, the equilibirum is stable.\n\n### 4. When $N_1$ and $N_2$ coexist\n\nSo interestingly when we look at the $N_1^*$ and $N_2^*$, the numerators $c_{11} - c{12}$ and $c_{22} - c_{21}$ show that for the equilibirum to be positive that means $c_11$ and $c_22$ (intraspecific competition) has to be greater than the interspecific competiton.\n\nSo what is the stability?\n\nWell, doing the nitty-gritty math of it. \n\n",
