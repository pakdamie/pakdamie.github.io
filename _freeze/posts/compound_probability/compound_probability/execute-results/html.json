I haven't really worked with stochasticity, so a lot of my \"work\" is following Melbourne and Hastings 2008^[1]^ [[1] Melbourne, Brett A., and Alan Hastings. \"Extinction risk depends strongly on factors contributing to stochasticity.\" Nature 454.7200 (2008): 100-103.]{.aside}, where in the supplementary material, they  explain how stochasticity is incorporated. The first model, the Ricker Poisson model, only includes demographic stochasticty.\n\n## The number of eggs is a Poisson process\nLike Melbourne and Hastings, we are modeling flour beetles. For an adult $i$, we can express the number of eggs ($B$) laid in its lifetime at time $t$ as:\n\n$$\nB_{i,t} \\sim Poisson(\\beta),\n$$\n\nwhere $\\beta$ is the mean number of births. \n\nWhat would this look like in code? We can use `rpois` to generate the number of eggs. On average, a flour beetle lays 30 eggs in its lifetime ($\\beta = 30$). Let's say there are 50 female adults that all lay eggs.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnumber_of_adults = 50 #50 adults\nnumber_of_eggs <- rpois(number_of_adults, lambda = 30) #Random amount of eggs\nfull_eggs_df <- data.frame(adult_id = 1:50, number_of_eggs)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can then visualize how much eggs each adult produced:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](compound_probability_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAnd we can visualize this as a distribution:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](compound_probability_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Survival of the eggs\n\nThe number of eggs surviving to adulthood is also influenced by stochasticty. I am only assuming density-independent mortality which I call $\\mu$ [In the paper, they actually include egg cannibalism by adults]{.aside}. If we assume that 25% of the individuals die (so 75% survivorship), then we can express the surviving eggs in the form of the binomial probability distribution. Specifically, of the offspring of adult $i$, how many of them are going to survive to produce their own eggs?\n\nThe binomial probability requires the number of trials (the offsprings) and the probability of survival. Basically, imagine that for each offspring, we are flipping a biased coin. The equation would then look like:\n\n$$\nS_{i,t+1} \\sim Binomial(B_{i,t}, (1- \\mu) ),\n$$\nwhere $S$ is the surviving offsprings of adult $i$.\n\nWe can code this by using a for-loop: \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfor (a in seq(1,50)){\nfull_eggs_df$survived[a] <- rbinom(n = 1, size = full_eggs_df$number_of_eggs[a], prob = 0.75)\n}\n\n###survival rate\nfull_eggs_df$surv_rate <-full_eggs_df$survived/full_eggs_df$number_of_eggs \n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThis plot shows that for each adult i who produced $B$ amount of eggs (grey bar), what are the proportion that survived? (black bar)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](compound_probability_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Compound distribution\n\nInterestingly, if we write the entire binomial distribution out:\n\n$$\nS_{i,t+1} \\sim Binomial(Poisson(\\beta), (1- \\mu)),\n$$\nwe can see this as a compound distribution or more specifically, a compound Binomial-Poisson distribution. We can reduce that gnarly equation. Let's find the expected number of surviving offspring which we call $\\mathbb{E}[S]$. Let us also find the expected number of eggs laid which is $\\mathbb{E}[Poisson(\\beta)]$. The mean of the Poisson distribution is just the parameter or $\\beta$. Therefore:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E} [S_{i,t+1}] \\sim Binomial(\\beta, (1- \\mu)),\n$$\n\n\nThe average number of successes or survival for a binomial distribution is simply $np$ where $n$ is the number of trials and $p$ is the probability of success.\n\nTherefore, $\\mathbb{E}[S] = \\beta (1- \\mu)$. This is saying the average number of eggs that will survive to lay the next generation is $\\beta (1 - \\mu)$. Because this is the average, we can then use the Poisson distribution (Rember, the expectation of the Poisson distribution is its parameter). We can then say that \n\n$$\nS_{i,t+1}  \\sim Poisson(\\beta(1- \\mu))\n$$\nThe total number of adults in the next generation is then:\n\n$$\nN_{t+1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_t} S_{i,t+1}\n$$\n\nWe can then make it simpler because of the rule that states: \n\n> Let $X \\sim Poisson(\\lambda_1)$ and let $Y \\sim Poisson(\\lambda_2)$, their sum is a Poisson distribution and $X+Y \\sim (\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2)$\n\nThat means that if we get the total average (or $N_t (1- \\mu)$) we can simplify this to:\n\n$$\nN_{t+1} \\sim Poisson (N_t (1- \\mu)).\n$$\nTA-DA this is how they got it!",
