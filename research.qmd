Here are the ghosts of my research past, present, and future. Being on the quantitative and theory side allows me to jump around different systems. While there are shared commonalities between all ecology topics (everything exist within a context), I love to dive deep into each system and learn their own uniqueness. But my favorite stomping grounds are in agricultural pests and vector-borne disease. The driving questions I have are:

1.  What is the role of timing in ecology?
2.  How does the climate influence the phenology or timing of the species? How can this change the stage-structure across the season? What does
3.  How can a broad community overview provide insight into processes such as phenology or disease?
4.  How can we combine theoretical ecology inform for management? Specifically, what are questions that are super interesting for both theory and applied people?

## Climate and tortricid moth pests

For my doctoral work with Dr. Ottar Bjornstad at Penn State, I worked on understanding how climate drives the timing of insect outbreaks. Specifically, I am interested in the role of climate on driving the phenology of tortricid moth pests. The spring emergence of the adult stages, for example, is influenced both by local temperatures and large scale-climate oscillations such as the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation (Local and Regional Climate Variables Driving Spring Phenology of Tortricid Pests: A 36-Year Study). Each tortricid species, because of their unique life-histories, are sensitive to these cues at different temporal windows. Additionally, I also use mathematical modeling to understand how diapause, a state of suspended development, can be incorporated for long-term forecasting (Incorporating Diapause to Predict the Interannual Dynamics of an Important Agricultural Pest)

Due to my interest in phenologyI was interested in looking at phenology in another system (Multiscale phenological niches of seed fall in diverse Amazonian plant communities). Using wavelet analysis, we analyzed these beautiful long-term time series for multiple plant species in Peru and Equador.

## A community perspective of vectors

I'm fascinated with vector communities. Generally, when we investigate vector-borne diseases, we focus on one species at a time. Yet, there are multiple vector species with their own unique ecologies. In collaborative work with Dr. Joyce Sakamoto (A 117-year retrospective analysis of Pennsylvania tick community dynamics), I helped to showcase just the cool differentiation.

Currently with my postdoctoral work with Tad Dallas, a project I'm hoping works out is understanding species shift. The dominant species in a community can change over time. Chagas disease is a great system because it is very interesting that the primary vector has shifted over time.
