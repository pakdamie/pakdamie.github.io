Here are the ghosts of research past, present, and future. Theory allows me to jump around different systems which makes me very happy because I am a jack-of-all trades. But my favorite stomping grounds are in agriculture and disease. The questions that I have are:

1.  What is the role of climate (specifically, changes in temperature) and its effect on insect or disease outbreaks?
2.  How can a broad community overview provide insight into processes such as phenology or disease?
3.  How can theoretical ecology inform for ecological management? Specifically, what are questions that are super interesting for both theory and applied people?

## Climate and tortricid moth pests

For my doctoral work with Dr. Ottar Bjornstad at Penn State, I worked on understanding the dynamics of insect outbreaks. Specifically, I am interested in the role of climate on driving the phenology of tortricid moth pests. The spring emergence of the adult stages, for example, is influenced both by local temperatures and large scale-climate oscillations such as the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation (Local and Regional Climate Variables Driving Spring Phenology of Tortricid Pests: A 36-Year Study). Each tortricid species, because of their unique life-histories, are sensitive to these cues at different temporal windows. Additionally, I also use mathematical modeling to understand how diapause, a state of suspended development, can be incorporated for long-term forecasting (Incorporating Diapause to Predict the Interannual Dynamics of an Important Agricultural Pest)

Due to my interest in phenologyI was interested in looking at phenology in another system (Multiscale phenological niches of seed fall in diverse Amazonian plant communities). Using wavelet analysis, we analyzed these beautiful long-term time series for multiple plant species in Peru and Equador.

## A community perspective of vectors

I'm fascinated with vector communities. Generally, when we investigate vector-borne diseases, we focus on one species at a time. Yet, there are multiple vector species with their own unique ecologies. In collaborative work with Dr. Joyce Sakamoto (A 117-year retrospective analysis of Pennsylvania tick community dynamics), I helped to showcase just the cool differentiation.

Currently with my postdoctoral work with Tad Dallas, a project I'm hoping works out is understanding species shift. The dominant species in a community can change over time. Chagas disease is a great system because it is very interesting that the primary vector has shifted over time.

My friends would rib on me all the time for saying "Moth is kinda like malaria if you squint really hard". With my postdoctoral work with Dr. Megan Greischar, I kind of got that going.
