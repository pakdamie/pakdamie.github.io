    "text": "Hello! I am an all-purpose quantitative and theoretical ecologist. Currently, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of South Carolina with the Tad Dallas lab. My background is generally involved with agricultural insects. My first love is parasitoid wasps and my doctoral work is understanding how temperature influences the outbreaks of tortricid moths! However, I also love disease ecology and understanding the different scales of disease. You can look at the projects I worked in my research tab. I also am trying to write more so I made this blog!\n\nOutside of my research, I am an avid theater fan and I have an obsession with opera and musicals. I also love video games (Dragon Age and Mass Effect). I’m also into cooking and constantly thinking about my fantasy cookbook project (My pitch: It’s Korean diaspora food and fused with other immigrant culture of the USA)."
