WORK IN PROGRESS

So in the previous section, we talked about the simplest differential equation which is population growth: both continuous and discrete. We found the analytically solutions but unfortunately most equations are not easy to solve by hand! We need to use numerical methods.

The easiest method is by our favorite mathematician man: Leonard Euler. His method of calculating the
