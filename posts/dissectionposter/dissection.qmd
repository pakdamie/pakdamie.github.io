## Introduction

It's good to look back and cringe. It's how we learn I guess. Here are two posters I made as a postdoc at Cornell.

## EEID 2022

I told my postdoc advisor that I wanted my poster to be "Hot Girl Summer" (Credit to Megan Thee Stallion). I'm not a fan of the quarter circle at all. Yes, it's eye catching, but it makes the white space almost awkward to use. In some ways, I think it makes it more non-functional. Look at me trying to fit the very rectangular plots in there! Notice the awkward placement of the legend in the bottom! Also with the circular design, it's hard to figure out how to read the poster. It's not a very logical, intuitive flow.

Shockingly, I also cannot believe that I put yellow on white - a design faux pas! I appreciate design, and I think that it is important for communicating ideas. However, design can definitely get in the way, and I think that is the case here. It's vibrant and colorful, but I think I needed to be more 'grounded'.

## EEID 2023

I then told my postdoc advisor that I wanted my poster to give "synthwave summer". I want to say that even if it's the same research, I got some new results! The format is more grounded- you go from top to bottom. There's a common rule that says not to have gradients as the background of the poster- but I am happy to break that rule. I think it's subtle, and that's the key to making it look good. I'm happier with the introduction/methods part of my poster.

My biggest regret is the last two plots at the bottom. My wife called it the "wiener dog plots" due to how long they are. In my head, I thought it was going to scream "Look at me! Look at me!" But they look very, very awkward. This could be easily fixed by reducing the width.

Overall, I'm happy with the look of this poster. I spent two days on it.
