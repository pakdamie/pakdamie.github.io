This is a list of things I learned. Generally involves my research, but you might see a weird aside.

## There is a website with english translation of 17th century mathematical books (Newton and Euler and etc.)

<http://www.17centurymaths.com>

## A stochastic SIS/SIR model is implicitly on a network

I mean intuitive, but never thought of it that way before.

## No one can explain stochastic SIS model well

Except for this guy: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr-DdOnkpro>

## Inverse Transform Sampling

You put your random uniform number in, you get an exponential distribution out

## Stochastic simulation is hard

But this guy has this blog: <https://lewiscoleblog.com/gillespie-algorithm>
