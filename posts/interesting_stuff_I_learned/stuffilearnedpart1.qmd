This is a list of things I learned. Generally involves my research, but you might see a weird aside.

## profvis is a cool package that helps you visualize profiling your code

And figure out where the slowdowns. I learned that the slowdowns are not exactly where I thought they would be?

## Save some miliseconds using rep_length instead of rep

Same function, but somehow it saves you a few seconds?

## Apply can be slow

I'm still trying to figure this out.

## You can create sparse Matrix using the package Matrix

I didn't realize how much a dense matrix that is only 20 x 20 can still be slow?

## Michelle Pfeiffer plays Amber's mom in the movie adaptation of Hairspray (2007)

And not Hannah Waddingham. I do not feel bad about this mistake- look it up!
