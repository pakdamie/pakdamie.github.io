### **Thermal performance curves** reveal variation in the seasonal niche of a short-lived annual

Hereford 2017

Interesting paper where I learned about MSDM (mechanical species distribution modeling). Mostly experimental, but the paper explores the thermal performance curves (TPCs) of differing genotype in *Mollugo verticillata* in California. Interestingly, they found that thermal breadth is negatively correlated with optimum temperature. Being more fit in warmer temperature comes at a cost of breadth. A question that I am curious about : is variation in TPC adaptive?
