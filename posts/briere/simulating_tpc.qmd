WORK IN PROGRESS

For a project, I'm perhaps interested in modeling different thermal performance curves. Using the Briere function, for example, the equation looks like this:

$$
aT(T - T_L)(T_U- T)^{1/d}
$$

as an example

Let's say T goes from 10 to 30 Celsius. a and d are parameters that are to be estimated.

```{r}
Temperature_range = seq(0,40)
a = 0.1
TL = 10
TU = 35
d = 2
```

```{r}
eef <- a * Temperature_range * (Temperature_range - TL) * (TU -Temperature_range)^(1/d)
```

```{r}
plot(Temperature_range, eef)
```
